# Welcome to MixView

Meet MixView: The mix tool for aspiring A1's that won't wreck your show. With direct connection to the X32/M32 console series and built in connectivity with TheatreMix, it's designed for the modern small-budget theatre, where all the good learning is happening.

MixView is designed to provide a stable real-time visual snapshot of everything the active A1 would be seeing; DCAs, a LR fader as controlled by TheatreMix, and an active TheatreMix cue view. It also provides a "DCA spill" mode which can be accessed by clicking on any of the channel names.
